### The Problem
The current registration process for events at our college involves the utilization of Google Forms to register participants and manual management of their details through Google Sheets. This method is notably time-consuming and demands extensive manual effort. Moreover, it often leads to discrepancies and necessitates collaboration among different teams.

Additionally, it lacks flexibility to accommodate scenarios such as on-spot registrations, managing OD (on-duty) requests seamlessly, and facilitating participant check-in and check-out at the venue. Consequently, it imposes a significant burden on the event team.

### The Solution
Event Registration System that is to be deployed on campus (college) to register for college events organized by different clubs.

The platform has two types of users, first the clubs that will create events and build the form that they want the participants to fill up.

The other being the college students that want to participate in that event and will register for our event.

For the club's users, the features would include creating an event, uploading a poster and other event details, manually add participant user, build form for participants, upload a CSV file to bulk create users, table that displays all users, and export feature to export the details of the users, a mailing feature to mail all the participants their registration details, including tickets with qr code.

The participants will get a link for that event that redirects to a form (build by the club on our platform only) in which he/she will fill up their details and other questions asked, and register for the events.

### Our Objectives

- __Efficient Registration Process__: Streamlining the event registration process to make it user-friendly, intuitive, and quick for attendees.

- __Secure Ticket Distribution__: Ensuring a secure ticket distribution system to prevent fraud and unauthorized access while providing ease of access for legitimate attendees.

- __Customization__: Allowing event organizers aka clubs to customize registration forms, ticket types, and pricing to suit their specific event requirements.

- __Communication__: Facilitating communication between event organizers and attendees through emails, reminders, and updates regarding the event.

- __User Experience__: Prioritizing a seamless and enjoyable user experience throughout the registration and ticket purchase process to encourage and repeat participation.
